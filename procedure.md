##### In order to perform the experiment, one need to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, select the arrival time distribution, set the values of parameters for the mean arrival rate, the mean service rate and the number of servers for the given GI/M/c/N model.
###### Step 2:  The mean arrival rate should always be less than the product of the mean service rate and the number of servers for the existence of steady-state solution.
###### Step 3:  Set the maximum number of customers in the system.
###### Step 4:  Click the 'Start' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 5:  Click the 'Stop' button to stop the experiment, and to view the steady-state result numerically and graphically.
###### Step 6:  Hence, the theoretical and experimental results can be compared.
